- [Jenkins Pipeline Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Create a new **Freestyle Job** in Jenkins that pulls a GitHub repo and runs a shell script.  
2. Write a basic **Jenkinsfile** (Declarative pipeline) and run it.

ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**  
- Using Jenkinsfile for CI/CD pipeline  
- Automating builds with Jenkins  
- Integrating Jenkins with Docker for containerized builds  
- Deploying applications using Jenkins  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [Jenkinsfile Tutorial](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Write a Jenkins pipeline to:  
   - Clone a GitHub repository  
   - Build a Docker image  
   - Push it to Docker Hub  
   - Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster (if available)  
2. Trigger Jenkins builds automatically with GitHub Webhooks.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 5: Jenkins Integration with Tools (1 Hour)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**

- [Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes/)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Set up a **GitHub Webhook** to trigger Jenkins builds automatically.  
2. Integrate **Jenkins with Docker** and push images to Docker Hub.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Part 6: Mock Interview Questions (1 Hour)**  
1. Explain the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment.  
2. How does Jenkins differ from GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD?  
3. What is a Jenkinsfile, and why is it used?  
4. How can you set up a Jenkins job to deploy applications automatically?  
5. How do you secure Jenkins and manage credentials?
