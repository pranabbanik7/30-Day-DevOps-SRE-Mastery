- Deploying an application to AWS/GCP/Azure/Kubernetes  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [GitHub Actions for CI/CD](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Write a GitHub Actions pipeline to:  
   - Build a Docker image  
   - Push it to **Docker Hub** or **GitHub Container Registry**  
   - Deploy the container to Kubernetes (if available)  
2. Example workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):  
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Build Docker Image
           run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
         - name: Push to Docker Hub
           run: |
             echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
             docker push myapp:latest
     deploy:
       needs: build
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
           run: kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yml
   ```  
3. Add **Secrets** in GitHub (`DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`).  
4. Push changes and verify that the pipeline runs successfully.

- Runners in GitLab CI/CD  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [GitLab CI/CD Configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Set up a new **GitLab project**.  
2. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the repository.  
3. Add the following simple pipeline:  
   ```yaml
   stages:
