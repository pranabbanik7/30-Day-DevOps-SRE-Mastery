1. Set up Git on your local machine and configure your username/email.  
2. Create a new Git repository, add files, and make your first commit.  
3. Clone an existing repository from GitHub/GitLab.

### **ðŸ“Œ Part 2: Git Branching & Merging (2 Hours)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**  
- Creating and switching branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git switch`)  
- Merging branches (`git merge`)  
- Handling merge conflicts manually

- [Git Merge vs Rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Create a new branch, switch to it, and make some changes.  
2. Merge the branch back into `main` and resolve any conflicts.  
3. Try rebasing a feature branch onto `main`.

### **ðŸ“Œ Part 3: Working with Remote Repositories (2 Hours)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**  
- Connecting local Git with remote repositories (`git remote add`)  
- Pushing changes to GitHub/GitLab (`git push`, `git pull`)  
- Forking and cloning repositories  
- Managing remote branches  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Push your local repository to GitHub.  
2. Clone a public GitHub repository and make changes.  
3. Fork a repository and submit a pull request.  

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Part 4: Git Collaboration & Best Practices (2 Hours)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**  
- Using `.gitignore` to exclude files  
- Git workflow strategies (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based Development)  
- Pull requests and code reviews  
- Cherry-picking commits (`git cherry-pick`)  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [GitHub Flow Explained](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)  
- [Git Best Practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/git-best-practices/)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Create a `.gitignore` file and test it with different files.  
2. Work in a team scenario by simulating a pull request workflow.  
3. Try cherry-picking a specific commit into another branch.  

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Part 5: Advanced Git & Troubleshooting (1 Hour)**  
ðŸ”¹ **Topics to Cover:**  
- Stashing changes (`git stash`)  
- Undoing changes (`git reset`, `git revert`, `git checkout`)  
- Bisecting bugs using `git bisect`  
- Debugging Git issues  

ðŸ”— **Resources:**  
- [Git Reset vs Revert](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting)  

ðŸ’» **Hands-on Exercise:**  
1. Use `git stash` to temporarily save changes and retrieve them later.  
2. Undo a commit using `git reset` and `git revert`.  
3. Debug a faulty commit using `git bisect`.  

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Part 6: Mock Interview Questions (1 Hour)**  
1. What are the differences between `git merge` and `git rebase`?  
2. How do you resolve a Git merge conflict?  
3. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?  
4. How do you undo the last commit without losing the changes?  
5. How do you set up a Git workflow for a team working on the same project?  

---

### **ðŸŽ¯ End-of-Day Checklist:**  
âœ… Completed all hands-on exercises  
âœ… Understood Git workflows and best practices  
âœ… Practiced interview questions
